## Overview  

**Born2beroot** is a system administration project from the 1337 School curriculum (part of the 42 Network) that introduces you to the fundamentals of virtualization, security, and server configuration.
The objective is to set up a secure virtual machine using Debian or Rocky Linux, implementing strict password policies, service configurations, and network security standards â€” all without a graphical interface.
