Born2beroot - Secure Virtual Machine Configuration üõ°Ô∏è


A project to master Linux system setup and security hardening

Overview

Born2beroot is a system administration project from the 1337 School curriculum (part of the 42 Network) that introduces you to the fundamentals of virtualization, security, and server configuration.

The objective is to set up a secure virtual machine using Debian or Rocky Linux, implementing strict password policies, service configurations, and network security standards ‚Äî all without a graphical interface.

Key Objectives

Learn how to install and configure a Linux distribution in a virtualized environment.

Understand user privilege management, security hardening, and firewall configuration.

Implement and manage LVM partitions.

Automate system monitoring through a custom Bash script.

Features

üß© Custom Virtual Machine Setup

Debian or Rocky Linux OS installation

Logical Volume Manager (LVM) partitioning

üîê Security Hardening

Password policy enforcement via PAM

Strict sudo permissions and logging

SSH configuration with disabled root login and custom port

Active firewall (UFW / Firewalld)

‚öôÔ∏è User Management

Dedicated user with sudo privileges

Proper group assignments for access control

üìä Monitoring Script (monitoring.sh)

Displays real-time system information every 10 minutes using wall

Includes CPU, memory, and disk stats, plus user and process counts

System Requirements
Requirement	Description
Virtualization Software	VirtualBox or UTM

Getting Started
üèóÔ∏è Installation Steps

Download ISO

Get Debian or Rocky Linux from their official sites.

Create the Virtual Machine

Name: Born2beroot

Type: Linux (64-bit)

Storage: 20 GB (LVM recommended)

RAM: 2048 MB

Install the OS

Use manual partitioning to configure LVM.

Create a non-root user with administrative privileges.

Install only essential system packages (no GUI).

üîß Post-Installation Configuration

Configure Sudo

Install and restrict sudo access to specific users.

Set Password Policy

Edit /etc/login.defs and /etc/security/pwquality.conf.

Firewall Setup

sudo ufw enable  
sudo ufw allow 4242/tcp  
sudo ufw status  


SSH Setup

Edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

Port 4242  
PermitRootLogin no  


Restart SSH service:

sudo systemctl restart ssh  

Monitoring Script

File: monitoring.sh
Purpose: Displays system metrics every 10 minutes.
