# Born2beroot - My Virtual Machine Setup


*My system administration and security project*
---
## What is this?
**Born2beroot** is a virtual machine that I set up and secured myself. It's a school project that helps me learn how to configure Linux systems, manage security, and work with servers. I'll use these skills in other system projects later.

## What I Configured

### Security Setup
- **Password Rules**: Strong password policies and user management
- **Firewall**: UFW firewall configuration and port management
- **SSH**: Secure remote access setup and key management

### System Services
- **Monitoring**: System monitoring scripts and cron jobs
- **Network**: Network configuration and service management
- **Users**: User groups, permissions, and sudo configuration

### Virtualization
- `VirtualBox`: Virtual machine creation and management
- `Debian/Rocky`: Linux distribution installation and setup
- `Partitions`: Disk partitioning with LVM encryption

## How to use it

### What you need
To run this virtual machine, you need:
- VirtualBox or similar virtualization software
- A computer with at least 4GB RAM
- Basic knowledge of Linux commands

### How to set it up
1. Download the VM files:
   ```bash
   # VM image and configuration files
   # (Usually provided as .vdi or .ova files)


2. Import and run:
   ```bash
   # Import the VM into VirtualBox
   # Start the virtual machine
   # Login with configured credentials
   ```

   This starts my configured secure virtual machine.
